    The page persists a "last used folder" the moment one is picked, so a test
    that never mentions the sidecar still rewrites the developer's own
    data/datalog.json. Worse, a test asserting "it reopens the last folder"
    would pass on a value an earlier test left behind -- the same failure mode
    _clear_streamlit_caches exists to prevent.

    Autouse and suite-wide, because the write happens deep inside the page
    rather than in the test, and nothing in the test names it. The two shared
    sidecars need no patch: runcard_tags.json and thresholds.json are written
    into the data root the caller passes, which is always tmp_path. That holds
    only while every storage entry point takes root_folder as an argument -- if
    one ever defaults to the remembered folder, it escapes this.
