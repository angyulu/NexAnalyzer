"""Page-level tests for pages/5_Runcard.py, for the three failures that only exist in the wiring.

These need the page script because each one is about an interaction between a
Streamlit widget and the state dict, which neither side shows on its own: a
write that escapes before the scan it precedes, a widget whose identity
outlives its data, and a heading drawn before its content is known. The pure
logic behind them is unit-tested in test_runcard_state.py.

`AppTest` runs the script in this process, so patching the *source* module
(`core.io.folder_picker`, `modules.runcard.io.config_store`) is enough -- the
page's `from x import y` lines re-execute on every run and pick the patch up.
