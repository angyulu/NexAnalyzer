"""
Integration test for the QC Report page (pages/2_QC_Report.py).

Drives the real Streamlit page through streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest, which is
the only way to cover the batch workflow's st.session_state coupling and the
page's own button wiring. Merged at v5.0.0 from the Sample Report and QC Panel
flow tests, whose pages this one replaces.

Uses the repo's real Silicon (Raman-only) preset from data/materials.json
rather than external sample data, so the test is self-contained. The
WSe2-specific panel contents are covered by tests/unit/test_peak_quality.py and
the table contents by tests/unit/test_qc_report_tables.py; what this covers is
that a folder goes in and seven figures plus a workbook come out.

The Raman fixtures deliberately carry three spectra per file. That is the
multi-spectrum shape real sample folders use — TSM260803's files hold 25 each —
and until v3.10.0 the report path parsed only the first two columns and
silently excluded every such file, so the Raman half produced nothing at all.
