Smoke test: every page renders without raising.

Cheap insurance against the failure mode a refactor actually causes — a stale
import or a renamed module that no unit test touches, which would otherwise
only surface as a red Streamlit traceback in front of a user. Rendering is all
this checks; page behavior is covered by the per-page integration tests.
