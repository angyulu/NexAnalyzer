:: and walk away: it installs Python and Git if they are missing, downloads
:: NexAnalyzer, puts a shortcut on the Desktop, and starts the app.

:: Nobody needs a terminal after this. The Desktop shortcut runs start.bat,
:: which updates the app from GitHub and then launches it.

:: Optional overrides, all normally unset:
::   NEXA_DIR         install folder      (default: %USERPROFILE%\nexanalyzer)
::   NEXA_REPO        repository to clone (default: the GitHub URL below)
::   NEXA_SETUP_ONLY  set to 1 to install without launching the app afterwards
