- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ PASSED (2025-12-13)

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for planning phase.

**Fixed Issues**:
- Removed technology-specific references (scipy, Plotly) from FR-027, FR-039, FR-049
- Removed "Plotly interactivity" reference from User Story 3 acceptance scenario
- All requirements now focus on capabilities and outcomes rather than implementation details
