## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 or macOS 12+
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **Git**: required for auto-updates — the app pulls the latest version on every launch
- **GitHub account**: not needed — the repository is public, so anyone can clone it
- **Disk space**: ~500 MB (including Python and dependencies)
- **Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)

---

## Easiest Setup: One-Click Installer (Windows)

**On Windows, this replaces Steps 1 to 3 entirely.**

1. Download **[Install-NexAnalyzer.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angyulu/NexAnalyzer/main/Install-NexAnalyzer.bat)** — right-click that link and choose
   **Save link as...**
2. Your browser will probably warn about keeping a `.bat` file. Choose **Keep**.
3. **Double-click the file you just downloaded.**

That is the whole setup. It installs Python and Git if they are missing, downloads NexAnalyzer
to `C:\Users\YourName\nexanalyzer`, puts a **NexAnalyzer** shortcut on your Desktop, and
starts the app. The first run takes a few minutes while it downloads the Python packages the
app needs — leave the window alone until your browser opens by itself.

**After that, just double-click NexAnalyzer on your Desktop.** It updates itself every launch.

> - If Windows asks permission while Git or Python installs, allow it.
> - If the window says it cannot see the newly installed program yet, close it and
>   double-click the file again — it carries on from where it stopped.
> - If it refuses because the folder is inside OneDrive or too deep in the filesystem, that is
>   deliberate: both break the app. Let it use the default location.

Steps 1 to 5 below are the manual route — use them on macOS, or on Windows if the installer
cannot run on your machine.

---

## Step 1: Install Python

### Windows

1. Go to **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. Click **"Download Python 3.x.x"** (the latest version)
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT**: Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** at the bottom of the installer
5. Click **"Install Now"**
6. Verify: Open **Command Prompt** (search "cmd" in Start menu) and type:
   ```
   python --version
   ```
   You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`.

### macOS

**Option A — Official installer:**
1. Go to **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. Download the macOS installer
3. Run the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts

**Option B — Homebrew (if you have Homebrew installed):**
```bash
brew install python3
```

**Verify**: Open **Terminal** and type:
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`.

---

## Step 2: Install Git

NexAnalyzer keeps itself up to date by pulling the latest version from GitHub every time you
launch it, and that needs Git. Without Git the app still runs — it just never updates.

### Windows

1. Go to **https://git-scm.com/downloads** and download **Git for Windows**
2. Run the installer and accept all the defaults — none of them need changing
3. Verify: open a **new** Command Prompt (an already-open one won't see the change) and type:
   ```
   git --version
   ```
   You should see something like `git version 2.47.0`.

### macOS

Git ships with the Xcode command line tools. Open **Terminal** and type:
```bash
git --version
```
If it's missing, macOS will offer to install it — accept. Or with Homebrew: `brew install git`.

---

## Step 3: Download NexAnalyzer

> **Clone it with Git — don't download the ZIP.** A ZIP copy has no Git history, so it can
> never auto-update: you would be frozen on whatever version you downloaded.

You don't need a GitHub account, and there is nothing to sign up for — the repository is
public, so the command below just works.

### Windows

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```
cd %USERPROFILE%
git clone https://github.com/angyulu/NexAnalyzer.git nexanalyzer
```

> **Don't clone into OneDrive, Dropbox, or any synced folder.** The app builds a `venv` folder
> holding thousands of files; sync clients fight with it, corrupt it, and slow every launch.
> `C:\Users\YourName\nexanalyzer` (as above) is a good spot.

The download starts immediately and takes a few seconds — there is no login step.

You will end up with `C:\Users\YourName\nexanalyzer` containing:

```
nexanalyzer/
├── app.py
├── start.bat          ← Windows launcher
├── start.sh           ← Mac/Linux launcher
├── requirements.txt
├── core/              ← platform code
├── modules/           ← analysis modules (spectra)
├── data/              ← material presets
└── ...
```

### macOS

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/angyulu/NexAnalyzer.git nexanalyzer
```

That's it — no login step.

---

## Step 4: Run NexAnalyzer

### Windows

1. Open the `nexanalyzer` folder in File Explorer
2. **Double-click `start.bat`**
3. A terminal window will appear. On **every** run it checks GitHub for a newer version
   (see [How Updates Work](#how-updates-work)). On the **first** run it also:
   - Creates a virtual environment (`venv` folder)
   - Installs all required packages
   - This may take 1-2 minutes
4. Your browser will automatically open to **http://localhost:8501**
5. To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window, or simply close it

### macOS

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the nexanalyzer folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/nexanalyzer
   ```
3. Make the script executable (first time only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
5. Every run checks GitHub for a newer version (see [How Updates Work](#how-updates-work));
   on the first run it also creates a virtual environment and installs packages
6. Your browser will open to **http://localhost:8501**
7. To stop the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

---

## Step 5: Create a Desktop Shortcut (Optional)

### Windows

1. Right-click `start.bat` → **Create shortcut**
2. Drag the shortcut to your Desktop
3. (Optional) Right-click the shortcut → **Properties** → **Change Icon** to customize

### macOS

1. Open **Automator** (search in Spotlight)
2. Choose **Application**
3. Add a **Run Shell Script** action with:
   ```bash
   cd ~/nexanalyzer && ./start.sh
   ```
4. Save as `NexAnalyzer` to your Desktop or Applications folder

**Alternatively**, create a simple alias in Terminal:
```bash
echo 'alias nexanalyzer="cd ~/nexanalyzer && ./start.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Then just type `nexanalyzer` in any terminal to launch.

---

## How Updates Work

**You don't need to do anything to stay current.** Every time you launch NexAnalyzer, the
launcher runs three steps before the app starts:

1. **Pull the latest version** from GitHub
2. **Install any new dependencies** listed in `requirements.txt`
3. **Start the app**

So the entire update procedure is: **close the app, launch it again.** No re-downloading, no
copying folders, no reinstalling.

Worth knowing:

- **Updating never blocks you.** If you are offline, GitHub is unreachable, or Git isn't
  installed, the launcher prints a warning and starts the version you already have.
- **Watch the terminal for one line.** `Up to date with the latest version.` means the update
  succeeded. Anything beginning with `[WARN]` or `[SKIP]` means you are running an **older**
  version — read the message; Troubleshooting below covers each one.
- **Your work is never overwritten.** The pull is fast-forward-only, so the launcher will never
  create a merge commit or discard local changes. If it cannot update cleanly, it stops.
- **Editing presets can block updates.** Changing material presets in the app rewrites
  `data/materials.json`, which is a shared, tracked file. Git then refuses to overwrite your
  edit, and updates stay blocked until you resolve it — see
  [Updates are blocked by local changes](#updates-are-blocked-by-local-changes).
- **Check which version you are on** at the bottom of the app's sidebar
  (e.g. `NexAnalyzer v3.0.0`).

## Quick Start: Auto-Workflow with Material Presets

NexAnalyzer processes spectra using the **auto-workflow** with a material preset — this is the only way to process a spectrum (as of v2.9.0 there's no manual step-by-step UI). It runs the entire pipeline (X-range crop, de-spiking, baseline correction, peak fitting) in a single click.

### 1. Configure a Material Preset

Material presets are created and edited directly in the app (as of v2.11.0 — no Excel file needed).

1. Open the **Material Presets** page (top of the sidebar navigation)
2. Expand **"➕ New material"** and fill in:
   - **Material name** and **Mode** (Raman or PL)
   - **Despike threshold**, **Baseline algorithm** (Polynomial / ALS / None (Skip)) and its parameters
   - Optionally: **X-range** limits, **exclusion ranges** (e.g. `240-270; 400-420`), and **notes**
   - **Peak templates**: add one row per peak (label, center, ± tolerance, FWHM, shape, color) — use the table's `+` button to add more rows
3. Click **"➕ Create Material"**

To change a material later, expand it in the list on the same page, edit its fields, and click **"💾 Save"** (or **"🗑️ Delete"** to remove it).

### 2. Load Your Spectrum Files

1. In the sidebar under **Load Spectra**, click **"Browse Spectrum Files"**
2. A native file dialog opens, filtered to `.txt` files (use the dropdown to switch to "All files" if needed)
3. Pick one file, or Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) to pick multiple files at once
4. Each file is parsed and added to the loaded-files list; files with multiple Y columns appear as separate entries named `file__1.txt`, `file__2.txt`, etc.
5. The mode (Raman/PL) is auto-detected from filename patterns (e.g., `RM*` → Raman, `PL*` → PL)
6. Re-picking a file that's already loaded is skipped silently (with a count); the dialog opens at the last-picked directory on subsequent uses

### 3. Select a Material

1. Back on the **Spectra** page, in the sidebar under **Material Presets**, use the **material dropdown** to select the target material (all configured materials are listed, both Raman and PL)
2. A summary of the preset settings (baseline algorithm, peak count, notes) appears below

### 4. Run the Workflow

**Single file:**
- Click **"Run Auto-Workflow"** to process the currently selected spectrum
- The pipeline executes: X-range crop → De-spike → Baseline correction → Peak fitting
- Results appear in the plot and fit results table below it

**All files (batch):**
- If multiple files are loaded, a **"Run All Files"** button appears
- Click it to process every loaded file using the selected preset
- A progress bar shows the batch status
- After completion, a summary shows how many files succeeded

### 5. Review and Export

- Use the **file navigation arrows** (above the plot) to browse through processed files
- Check the **fit results table** below each plot for peak parameters and R² values
- In the sidebar, use **Quick Export** to download PNG/HTML/CSV, or **Batch Export** to download a master CSV across all fitted files

## Sample Report: One-Click PPTX from a Sample Folder

The **Sample Report** page (top of the sidebar navigation) turns a sample folder's 9-point OM + Raman + PL measurement grid into a three-slide PowerPoint report, with no manual plotting.

### 1. Name the folder after the wafer

**The folder's own name becomes the wafer ID on the report.** It is used verbatim in the header
of all three slides, and as the default filename (`<foldername>_Report.pptx`). There is no field
in the app to type or correct it, and nothing validates it — so a folder called
`New folder (2)` produces a report titled `New folder (2)`.

Name the folder after the wafer, for example `VABA52`. To fix a wrong title, rename the folder
and generate the report again.

### 2. Put the measurement files in it

Your sample folder should contain, for each of the 9 grid points:
- A Raman spectrum named like `RM_1.txt` … `RM_9.txt` (also accepts `Raman_`, `rm_`, `raman_`, and either `-` or `_` before the number, e.g. `RM-8.txt`)
- A PL spectrum named like `PL_1.txt` … `PL_9.txt` (or `pl_`)
- An OM image named like `100x_1.bmp` … `100x_9.bmp` (any magnification prefix works, e.g. `10x_`; `.bmp`/`.png`/`.jpg`/`.tif` all accepted)

Any other file in the folder (old exports, project files, etc.) is simply listed as "ignored" — it doesn't need to be removed. A technique with no matching files (or no configured preset) is just left out of the report rather than causing an error.

### 3. Generate the report

> **First, make sure the material exists.** Add it on the **Material Presets** page, with peak
> templates for both Raman *and* PL. A technique with no preset for the chosen material is left
> out of the report silently rather than reported as an error — so a missing PL preset simply
> means no PL slide, with nothing on screen explaining why.

1. Click **"Select Sample Folder"** and pick the folder
2. If OM images exist at more than one magnification, pick which one to use in the **3x3 grid**
3. Pick the **Material** (the same materials configured on the Material Presets page — one dropdown selects both the Raman and PL preset for that material). Your last choice is remembered the next time you open this page.
4. Click **"🚀 Generate Report"** — every Raman/PL file is fit against the selected presets, with a progress bar
5. The generated slides appear on-screen: an overview (OM grid + fit-summary tables), then a 3x3 grid of each point's individually fitted Raman spectrum, then the same for PL

### 4. Save

Click **"💾 Save Report As..."** and choose a location — this writes the `.pptx` plus three page images (`_page1.png`, `_page2.png`, `_page3.png`) alongside it, matching the three slides.

> **Note:** The on-screen/saved slide *images* require Microsoft PowerPoint to be installed (used to render the preview) — the `.pptx` file itself always saves regardless.

## File Format

NexAnalyzer accepts **two-column .txt files**:

```
120.5	1523.2
121.0	1540.8
121.5	1535.1
...
```

- **Column 1**: Wavenumber (cm⁻¹) or Wavelength (nm)
- **Column 2**: Intensity
- **Delimiter**: Tab or comma
- **No header row**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"
- **Windows**: Reinstall Python and make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"**. Then restart your terminal.
- **Mac**: Make sure `python3 --version` works in Terminal. If not, reinstall from python.org.

### "pip install fails" or network errors
- Check your internet connection — packages are downloaded from the internet on first run
- If behind a corporate proxy, ask your IT team for proxy settings
- Try running manually:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### The browser doesn't open automatically
- Manually open your browser and go to **http://localhost:8501**

### "Address already in use" error
- Another instance of NexAnalyzer (or another Streamlit app) is already running
- Close the other terminal window, or run on a different port:
  ```
  streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
  ```

### App is slow or unresponsive
- Large files or many loaded spectra can use significant memory
- Try loading fewer files at once
- Close other browser tabs to free memory

### Updates are blocked by local changes

The launcher prints `[WARN] Update BLOCKED by your local changes` and lists the files. This
almost always means you edited material presets in the app, which rewrites the shared
`data/materials.json`. **You will keep launching an old version until this is resolved.**

Set your changes aside, then update:
```
git stash
```
Relaunch the app. To bring your changes back afterwards:
```
git stash pop
```

If you don't need your local edits and just want the official version:
```
git checkout -- data/materials.json
```

> If your preset changes *should* be shared with the team, send them to Angyu rather than
> keeping them local — presets are committed to the repo so everyone gets them on update.

### "[SKIP] Git not found - cannot auto-update"

Git isn't installed, or isn't on your PATH. Redo [Step 2](#step-2-install-git), then open a
**new** terminal — an already-open one won't pick up the change.

### "[SKIP] Not a git checkout - cannot auto-update"

You downloaded a ZIP instead of cloning, so there is no Git history to update from. Copy out any
files you care about, delete the folder, and redo [Step 3](#step-3-download-nexanalyzer) using
`git clone`.

### "Repository not found", or GitHub asks you to sign in

The repository is public, so you should never be asked to log in. A sign-in prompt or a
"not found" error almost always means the URL is wrong — GitHub reports a mistyped URL as
"not found" rather than admitting the repo doesn't exist. Check it character for character:

```
https://github.com/angyulu/NexAnalyzer.git
```

If the URL is right and it still fails, the repository may have been switched to private —
ask Angyu for access.

### "[WARN] Could not update - offline, or no access to the repo"

Harmless if you are off the network — the app starts on your current version. If you *are*
online, check that https://github.com/angyulu/NexAnalyzer opens in your browser. A corporate
proxy or firewall blocking GitHub is the other usual cause; ask IT for the proxy settings.

### Forcing an update by hand

Normally unnecessary, since relaunching the app updates it. But from inside the `nexanalyzer`
folder you can always run:
```
git pull
```
