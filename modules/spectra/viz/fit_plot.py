Static fit figures for export and reports.

Where live_plot.py renders the interactive, session-state-driven multi-layer
plot on the Analysis page, this module builds standalone figures with no
session-state dependencies: the data + fit + components view used for PNG/HTML
export, and the Sample Report's stacked per-column grids.

Rendering these to the page goes through core.viz.render.render_plot().
