"""
Metrics derived from a fit result: the per-peak numbers every reporting
surface displays, and their aggregation across a set of fits.

Two quantities, two names, used consistently everywhere:

- **intensity** — the fitted curve's maximum, via `peak_intensity_and_stderr`.
  This is what every reporting surface shows, because it's the number
  spectroscopists read off a plot: the on-screen Fit Results table, the
  exported CSVs, the Sample Report's summary tables and its LA/E2g+A1g ratio
  all agree on it.
- **area** — the area under the peak, `FittedPeak.area`, which is intensity x
  FWHM x 1.064 for a Voigt. It is what lmfit solves for and what lmfit itself
  calls "amplitude", which is exactly why it is named `area` here.

The two diverge whenever peaks have unequal widths: WSe2's LA mode is ~6x
broader than E2g+A1g, so their area ratio is ~4.3x their intensity ratio. The
Sample Report used to report area under an "Amplitude" heading while the CSV
used that same heading for intensity, and the two surfaces disagreed.

Don't reintroduce that. "Amplitude" names neither quantity anywhere in the
codebase; a caller that wants the integrated quantity takes `FittedPeak.area`
and labels it "area".
