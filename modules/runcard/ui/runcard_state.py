"""Session state for the Runcard page.

Its own namespace, separate from the QC Report's folder-and-sample model: that
page reads one folder as one sample and produces one set of figures, while this
one reads a folder as a *list* of recipes and draws whichever of them the
operator ticks. A single-sample shape has nowhere to put the other thirty-nine.

A plain dict rather than a dataclass, matching the other state modules —
callers mutate it in place and Streamlit persists the object. It has no
migration story, so read any key added later with `.get()`.

**One spelling per function.** The stemmed names — `initialize_runcard_state`,
`get_runcard_state`, after `modules/optical/ui/qc_report_state.py` — are the
whole public API. Bare `initialize_state`/`get_state` aliases sat beside them
for a while so a caller could pick either; that is the shape this repo already
refuses for the diagnostic ratios (one constant, not the pair written out
again). Two names for one function have nothing keeping them in step, so the
day one of them grows a guard the other lacks, the same call reads as correct
at both sites and only one of them is.
