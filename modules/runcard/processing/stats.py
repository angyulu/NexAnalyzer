"""
Everything the runcard figure needs worked out before anything is drawn: the
metrics row, the gantt rows, the gas on/off events, and the setpoints holding
at the growth midpoint.

All of it used to be computed **inside** the renderer of the app this was
ported from — a 330-line function that measured, formatted and emitted SVG in
one pass, so the five numbers the page put above the chart could only be got at
by rendering the chart. Pulled out here they are pure, testable, and readable
by a table that draws no chart at all: the Runcard page's folder listing is one
`profile_stats` call per recipe and no figures.

Nothing in this module knows a colour, a pixel or a font. `viz/profile.py`
owns those, and it is the only caller that needs all of this at once.

**Two display guards are deliberately fixed here** where `growth_window.py`
reproduces its own verbatim. The ancestor tested `if gw_start` rather than `if
gw_start is not None` when converting the window edges to minutes, and again
when suppressing gas markers inside the window — while the band itself was
drawn on `is not None`. A window starting at exactly t=0 therefore got a drawn
band, a printed duration, and an empty "Growth window" metric beside them. The
metrics row and the band it sits above have to agree about whether there is a
window, so both guards read `is not None` here.

#: reasoning that a marker appearing where no bar starts reads as a rendering
#: fault. The cost was worse: a recipe idling H2Se at 0.01 sccm — its purge
#: flow — had that line's open and close dropped from the plot entirely, so two
#: markers the historical figures show were simply missing. A marker without a
#: visible bar says "the recipe addressed this line here", which is true and
#: worth saying; the bar floor answers the different question of whether a
#: sliver is wide enough to read.
MARKER_FLOOR = 0.0

#: Never marked on/off. Both are carriers: Ar is open for most of a run on

#: labels for a valve that was always going to be open.
SKIP_SPECIES = frozenset({"Ar", "N2", "N₂"})
