"""
The runcard profile chart: a reconstructed recipe drawn as one Plotly figure.

Two stacked panels over one shared time axis. The top panel is the heater's
reconstructed temperature with its synthesized cooldown tail, the preheaters as
dashed lines, the growth window as a shaded band, and a marker wherever a
reactive gas opened or closed. The bottom panel is a gantt: one row per gas
line, then the throttle valve, the pressure controllers and the stage, each
segment shaded by how far its setpoint sits toward that row's maximum. Under
both, a summary block naming what was holding at the growth midpoint.

Pure — no Streamlit, no file access. `core.viz.render.render_plot()` is what
puts the figure on a page, and `core.io.export` is what turns it into a PNG.

This replaces a hand-written SVG renderer, and three of its decisions are
deliberately not carried over:

- **Hover adds to what is printed; it does not replace it.** This figure
  briefly moved the marker temperatures, the bar units and the preheater hold
  temperatures into hover alone, on the reasoning that Plotly can measure text
  where SVG cannot and so need not print what it might have to clip. That was
  wrong, and the way it was wrong is worth recording: a figure exported as a
  PNG for a report, or held up beside one of the reference's, has no hover at
  all, and every one of those numbers had simply vanished. They are printed
  again. Hover still carries a segment's true span, which is the one thing no
  label can show once a sliver has been widened to stay visible.
- **The fallback colour for an unrecognised gas is deterministic.** It was
  `FALLBACK_COLORS[hash(name) % 2]`, and Python salts string hashes per
  process, so the same recipe came out violet one morning and teal the next.
  `zlib.crc32` is stable across runs and machines.
- **The stage row is shaded like every other row.** The ancestor formatted spin
  values into strings (`"10 rpm"`) before drawing, which made its own
  `isinstance(val, float)` shading test fail, so the row always came out flat.
  Units live on the row here, so the values stay numeric.

**The RTV row is "RTV P", in Torr.** This app briefly drew it as "RTV" with no
unit, reasoning that `params[1]` of `RTV Pressure Ctrl` ranges over
{10, 60, 70, 90} while VBBE00's measured tube pressure during the controlled
segment is ~7.9 Torr — so the number looked like neither the gauge range nor
the achieved pressure, and labelling it a pressure looked like a guess. The
reference renderer answers it directly: the second column is the gauge range
and the third is *the chamber-pressure setpoint the recipe commands*. The
recipe asks for 60 Torr; the chamber settles somewhere else. A setpoint and a
measurement are allowed to differ, and this chart draws recipes.

#: draws nothing at all, so the operator reads a gap at exactly the moment the
#: recipe did something; the ancestor clamped every bar to one pixel and drew a
#: tick there.
#:
#: The clamp is in **data units** rather than pixels because Plotly has no
#: pixel-width bars and because a fraction of the recipe's own length is the
#: only minimum that survives a resize: a figure is drawn at whatever width the
#: browser gives it, and a fixed number of seconds is invisible on a
#: 130-minute card and a fat block on a five-minute one. 0.4 % is ~4 px of a
#: 1000 px plot area — a tick, not a bar — and it grows under zoom, so zooming
#: into one turns it into a sliver that can be read rather than into nothing.
#:
#: It is applied to every segment, not only to the exactly-zero ones: a
#: threshold that fired at 0 s and not at 0.1 s would leave the next-shortest
