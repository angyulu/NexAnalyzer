"""
Image 1 of the QC Panel: the optical-microscopy analysis figure.

Layout follows the WSe2 analysis grid this replaces — nine grid positions as
Original / segmented-overlay pairs, three positions per row — with one addition:
a row of the nine green-channel histograms underneath, each marked with its mode
and both thresholds.

That row is the point of the figure. Coverage percentages alone cannot show
whether a frame segmented sensibly; the predecessor algorithm's characteristic
failure was every position reading 99 %+ of one class, and in the overlay that
looks like a clean wafer rather than a broken measurement. The histogram shows
where the thresholds actually landed, so a saturated frame is visible as one.

matplotlib rather than Plotly: these are static report images, an eighteen-frame
raster montage is not something Plotly renders well, and matching the inherited
figures matters more here than matching the app's interactive charts.

    Render the OM analysis figure and return it as PNG bytes.

    `points` names the grid positions to lay out, so a sample missing positions
    still puts the ones it has in the right cells rather than closing the gaps —
    several wafers in the archive carry only six frames, and one only positions
    4 to 6. Defaults to the positions present in `frames`.

    `show_histograms` draws the diagnostics row. It exists because this figure
    serves two audiences: the histograms are what make a saturated frame legible
    *as* one, which is exactly what an internal reviewer needs and exactly what
    a customer reading a report does not. Call it twice -- the segmentation is
    already done by then, so the second call is the ~5 s render, not the ~30 s
    analysis.

    Returns PNG bytes rather than a Figure so callers cannot leak one: an
    un-closed matplotlib figure holds its canvas for the life of the process,
    and this draws nineteen axes of raster per sample.
