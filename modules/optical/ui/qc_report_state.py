"""Session state for the QC Report page.

Its own namespace, separate from the Spectra page's `files`/`current_file`
(that page's per-file model): a sample folder's spectra and nine microscope
frames don't fit a single-file-at-a-time shape.

This is the merge of `sample_report` and `qc_panel`, which were two dicts for
two pages reading the same folder until v5.0.0. They are one page now, so the
reason they were kept apart — either silently invalidating the other's results
— no longer applies.

A plain dict rather than a dataclass, matching the other state modules —
callers mutate it in place and Streamlit persists the object. It has no
migration story, so read any key added later with `.get()`.
