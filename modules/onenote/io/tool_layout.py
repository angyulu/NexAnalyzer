"""Where a tool folder keeps each artifact, and how to find one wafer's.

Point the app at a tool folder — ``...\\Data Collection\\HA1P01`` — and this
resolves a wafer ID to its optical folder, its runcard and its datalog, which
live in three unrelated subfolders.

**The layout is declared, not inferred, because there is no convention to
infer.** A survey of all twelve tool folders on the share found the runcard
folder spelled four ways (``RUNCARD``, ``Runcard``, ``Run Card``, absent), the
optical folder six (``OPTICALS``, ``Optical Properties``, ``Raman&PL``,
``RAMAN&PL``, ``RAMAN``, ``Characterization``), a depth to a wafer of anywhere
from one to four levels, and an intermediate tier that is a month in one tool,
a wafer-prefix in another and a technique in a third. Only two of the twelve
have a datalog at all. Worse, the older tools key their files on a run serial
(``NSHA1P012512001``) rather than a wafer ID, so a wafer-ID lookup can never
find anything in them.

A loader that guessed would therefore return an empty result for most tools
while looking like it had searched. ``data/tool_layouts.json`` holds one entry
per tool instead, and an unknown tool raises rather than resolving to nothing:
a QC tool that silently finds no data is worse than one that says it does not
know where to look.

**It ships with HA1P01 alone.** Adding a tool is an entry in that file, not a
change here.

**Two things no rule can fix**, and callers must render them as *not linked*
rather than *missing* — the file exists, it just cannot be addressed by name:

- 219 of HA1P01's 378 wafers have no findable datalog. 1186 of its 1404
  datalog CSVs carry no ``~<WAFER>`` at all; the logger never wrote the ID.
  ``runcard_tags.json`` recovers 20 more wafers and no more.
- 19 wafers have optical data and no runcard under any glob.

The optical side needs two patterns because the naming changed mid-2026:
``OPTICALS/202609/HADH51/`` is a folder per wafer, while the twelve earlier
months are flat ``.wip`` files. Five months before that key on a run serial and
are unreachable by wafer ID at all — 130 entries that are archive, not a bug.
