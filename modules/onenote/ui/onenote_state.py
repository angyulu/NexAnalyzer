"""Session state for the OneNote page.

Its own namespace, matching the other state modules. A plain dict rather than
a dataclass — callers mutate it in place and Streamlit persists the object. It
has no migration story, so read any key added later with `.get()`.

**The upload log is a selection, not an artifact.** Everywhere else in this
app a derived key is dropped the moment its input changes, because a stale
figure sitting under a new sample's name is a lie. The log is the exception:
it records what *happened* — this artifact went to this page at this time, or
failed with this error — and that stays true no matter what the operator picks
next. Dropping it on a folder change would erase the record of a failed upload
at exactly the moment the operator moved on, which is the silent loss the
non-blocking design was chosen to avoid.

So `_SELECTIONS` carries the log, and `reset_results` leaves it alone. A
Streamlit `st.error` is not enough on its own: it vanishes on the next rerun,
and a rerun is one widget click away.
