"""
The two datalog figures: one run's channels stacked, and several runs overlaid
on a common process t=0.

Both are stacked subplots with a shared x-axis, one panel per selected channel,
because that is how a process engineer reads a run — pressure against heater
against flow, at the same instant, with a zoom on one panel driving all of
them. A single panel with eight y-axes is the alternative and it is unreadable
at the fourth trace.

Pure Plotly: figures out, nothing rendered. The page hands them to
`core.viz.render.render_plot`, which is the only place in this app that calls
`st.plotly_chart`.

    One run: a panel per selected channel, against wall-clock time.

    A PV/SV panel draws three traces — the process value solid, its setpoint
    dashed, and a marker trace sitting on the PV line wherever that sample was
    out of tolerance. The markers are ``df[pv_col].where(mask)``: full-length x,
    NaN everywhere in tolerance, so the dots land **on** the offending part of
    the trace rather than in a separate strip that has to be read back against
    it.

    **No legend at all.** Every trace sets ``showlegend=False``, and the panels
    are identified by their subplot title and y-axis title instead. A legend
    would repeat the panel titles verbatim and, in a twelve-panel stack, would

    Several runs, overlaid on a common process t=0.

    ``align_times[i]`` becomes t=0 for ``runs[i]`` — the timestamp the heater
    setpoint settled at its final value, per
    `analysis.find_final_plateau_start`. The x-axis is elapsed seconds from
    that instant, negative before it, so every run's growth phase starts at the
    same place and the dotted vertical line at 0 is the common reference.
    Overlaying on wall-clock start instead puts each run's growth at a different
    x, because runs spend different amounts of time in load, pump-down and
    purge, and then nothing lines up with anything.

    **Only the PV side is drawn**, and violation markers are not drawn at all:
    this figure answers "did these runs do the same thing?", and a second
    dashed trace per run plus red dots turns eight lines into twenty-four.
    Setpoints and tolerances belong to the single-run view.
