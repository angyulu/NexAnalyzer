"""
Renaming runs to ``<timestamp>[~tag].csv``, and keeping their tags attached.

**The target format is frozen**: datalog_monitor writes the same names, the
Runcard check reads the tag back out of them, and `tag_store._tag_from_filename`
recovers a tag by splitting on the delimiter. A run named
``2026-08-06_173312~VBBE00.csv`` is self-describing — copy it out of the folder,
away from `runcard_tags.json`, and it still says which runcard it belongs to.
That is the whole reason for renaming at all.

Renames happen **in place**, via `Path.with_name`: same directory, same suffix,
only the stem changes. Nothing here moves a file between folders, and nothing
here writes a tag it was not already given.

Two operations, and the difference matters when something goes wrong.
`apply_rename` raises, so a single-file button can say why. `execute_sweep`
catches per file and keeps going, because one run locked open in Excel must not
abort a rename of four hundred others.

    Raises
    ------
    RenameCollision
        Something already occupies the target name. Checked again here rather
        than trusting `plan.collision`, which was computed when the plan was
        built. Nothing has been touched.
    OSError
        The file is locked, gone, or the folder is read-only — either on the
        rename itself, or on the sidecar write, in which case the rename has
        been undone.
    ValueError
        `plan` was built against a different root folder — the file is outside
        `root_folder`, so `tag_store._relative_key` cannot key it. The rename is
        undone before this surfaces, but `ui.datalog_state.reset_rename_results`
        still drops a pending plan the moment the folder changes: a plan that
        reaches here is already a bug, and one whose rollback fails renames a
        file the operator is no longer looking at.
    TagOrphaned
        The re-key failed *and* the rollback failed. The only outcome that
        leaves the pair half-applied.
