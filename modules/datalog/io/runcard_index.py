"""
Reading what `processing.runcard_match` compares: the recipe folder and the runs.

**The one place `datalog` reads `runcard`'s files**, and it does so through
`modules.runcard.io.parser.parse_runcard` rather than a second parser: the two
packages were independent until runcard matching needed both, and a recipe
parsed two ways is a recipe that can mean two things. The dependency runs one
way only -- nothing in `modules.runcard` imports `datalog`.

No Streamlit here; `scanner` stays the only module in this package that
imports it. The page caches around these functions, keyed on
`runcard_signature` and on each run's mtime.
