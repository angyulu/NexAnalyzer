"""
Per-folder PV/SV tolerances: the `thresholds.json` sidecar.

**The on-disk format is frozen**, for the same reason as `runcard_tags.json`:
this file lives inside the operator's data folder, not in the repo, and
datalog_monitor reads and writes the same one. It travels with the data, so a
folder carries its own tolerances to whatever machine opens it next.

      "global_default_pct": 5.0,

      "timing_tolerance_pct": 5.0,
      "timing_floor_sec": 2.0
    }

The two ``timing_*`` keys belong to the Runcard check, not to anything here,
and that is precisely why `save_thresholds` merges rather than overwrites —
see its docstring for the bug that shape fixes.

The JSON primitives are imported from `tag_store` rather than repeated: both
files are read by another application, and the atomic write is the property
that must not drift between them.

    bug.** Its Datalog view saved only ``global_default_pct`` and
    ``overrides``, which erased ``timing_tolerance_pct`` and
    ``timing_floor_sec`` from the file — so an operator who had tuned the
    Runcard check's timing tolerance lost it, silently, by adjusting a PV/SV
    band on a different page. `load_thresholds` backfills defaults, so the loss
    was invisible until someone noticed the timing check had gone back to
    5 % / 2 s.

    Merging costs the ability to *delete* a top-level key, which nothing wants,

    depends on: ``overrides`` is replaced wholesale by whatever is passed.
