"""
Finding and reading the tool controller's datalog CSVs.

One CSV per run, written live by the controller at 1 Hz: 39 columns of
timestamp, recipe step, and fourteen PV/SV pairs. Two entry points, and the
split between them is the whole design:

- `scan_folder` lists a folder. It reads each file as **text**, keeping the
  first line, the last line and a count, and parses exactly two timestamps per
  file. A folder of several hundred runs lists instantly.
- `load_run` parses one run properly, which for the ground-truth file means the
  python CSV engine building 39 typed columns over 6903 rows, a datetime parse
  and 36 numeric coercions. It happens lazily, only for the run the operator
  actually opened.

Listing a folder by fully parsing every CSV is the version of this that does
not survive contact with a real ``HA_DataRecord`` tree — tens to hundreds of
milliseconds and several megabytes of frame per file, for four scalars per row
of the list.

**This is the one module under `modules/datalog/io/` that imports Streamlit**,
and the reason is the caching, not convenience. The page's run table lives in
a fragment that re-runs every 60 seconds so a run written while the operator
is watching appears on its own; without the per-file cache below, each of
those ticks would re-read every CSV in the tree. The layering rule this bends
is real, so it is bent exactly here: nothing else in this package imports
Streamlit, and `processing/analysis.py` and `viz/charts.py` stay importable
headless.

    like database connections — so the source app's ``_mtime`` spelling meant
    this function was keyed on `path` alone and kept serving the first parse of
    a file the controller was still writing to. Renaming it is the fix; putting
    the underscore back re-breaks it silently.

    Three decisions in four lines:

    1. ``on_bad_lines="skip"`` with ``engine="python"``, together. A datalog can
       be truncated mid-line by a crash or by being copied mid-write, and can
       carry rows with the wrong field count. Skipping costs one sample;
       raising costs the whole run. The python engine is the tolerant parser,
       and it is slower — which is exactly why the list view does not come
       through here.
    2. The timestamp format is pinned and ``errors="coerce"``. No inference, so
       no locale or dayfirst ambiguity and no per-row fallback parsing; an
       unparseable stamp becomes NaT instead of raising.
    3. Those NaT rows are dropped immediately, so **every row that leaves here
       has a valid Time**. The index is *not* reset afterwards: it keeps gaps
       but stays monotonically increasing, which is the property the
       label-based slicing in `analysis._build_segment` depends on.

    Numeric coercion is a pure exclusion rule — everything that is not
    categorical and not the timestamp — so a column added to a future datalog
