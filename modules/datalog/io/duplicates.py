"""
Runs stored twice, because something outside this app put the old name back.

The operator's analysis folder is fed by a copier that matches on **filename**
and only ever adds — it never deletes and it does not follow renames. Rename a
run here and its source file looks absent on the copier's next pass, so the
original ``DDHHMMSS.csv`` name is copied back in and the folder holds the same
run twice: once under the recorder's name, once under `renamer.target_filename`'s.

Measured cadence on HA1P01 is about three minutes, and the copier runs on the
tool PC, not on the machine showing this page. That single fact decides the
shape of this module. Deleting a stale copy is a race this side cannot win —
the file is back before the operator has looked away — so removal is the
*secondary* answer here and hiding is the primary one:

- `without_duplicates` is what the run list renders. A run that exists twice on
  disk is shown once, under its renamed form, however often the old name comes
  back. Nothing is touched, so there is no race to lose.
- `find_duplicates` and `remove_duplicates` reclaim the space when the operator
  asks, by way of the Recycle Bin.

Both read the same `stale_copies` rule, which is the property worth keeping:
what the list hides is exactly what cleanup would remove, so the preview the
operator confirms cannot disagree with the table they were just looking at.

**Nothing in this app creates these.** `renamer.apply_rename` renames and rolls
back; it never copies. Debugging starts at the copier, not here.

Two guards stop a removal ever costing data:

- A file is only ever a candidate when some *other* file in the same directory
  already carries the canonical name for that run. No canonically-named file in
  the group means the group is left alone — that is not a rename artifact, and
  there is no basis for picking a survivor.
- Candidacy needs identical **bytes**, not merely the same run. A truncated or
  half-copied near-duplicate is reported as nothing at all: it stays on disk and
  stays *visible* in the list, which is where a human will notice it.
