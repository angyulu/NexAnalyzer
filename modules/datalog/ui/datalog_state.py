"""Session state for the Datalog page.

Its own namespace, separate from the QC Report's folder-and-scan model: that
page reads one sample folder and derives everything from a single batch run,
while this one points at a tree of several hundred live CSVs and derives
nothing until the operator picks a run out of it. The expensive results here
are cached against each file's mtime in `io.scanner`, not held in session
state, so what is left to keep is small.

Named for its page, and its functions with it, matching
`modules.optical.ui.qc_report_state`. It was `ui/state.py` with bare
`get_state`/`initialize_state` briefly: two modules called `ui.state` read
identically at an import site and at the top of a traceback, and the page that
imports both ends up aliasing one of them, which is the point at which "the
module path already says datalog" stops being true.

A plain dict rather than a dataclass, matching the other state modules —
callers mutate it in place and Streamlit persists the object. It has no
migration story, so read any key added later with `.get()`.
