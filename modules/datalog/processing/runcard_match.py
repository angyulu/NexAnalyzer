"""
Which runcard a datalog run was programmed from: replay each recipe against the log.

Most of a tool's datalogs arrive untagged -- the controller names them by a
timestamp and nothing else -- while the runcard that drove each run sits in a
folder beside them. This module reads both and says which card produced which
log, so the Datalog page can offer the name instead of the operator working it
out from memory. The method and the numbers behind every constant are in
[docs/Runcard_Matching.md](../../../docs/Runcard_Matching.md); what follows is
what the code has to get right.

**Both sides are reduced to the same thing: blocks.** A block is the set of
setpoint changes applied together, the wait that follows, and the heater SV at
the end of that wait. A runcard yields them by replaying its commands; a
datalog yields them from the SV columns it logs at 1 Hz.

**The clock is a *wait clock*, and it is not the recipe clock.** Only rows the
controller spent in `Wait` advance it. Pumping, Check Status, Check PC and
Stage Pos last as long as the chamber takes, which the runcard does not say --
`modules.runcard`'s timeline charges Check Status a nominal 10 s, and that is
right for drawing a recipe and wrong here, where the log shows the same step
taking one second. Counting only waits on both sides is what lets a card line
up against a log without any time warping. Do not "fix" this to use
`growth_window.build_timeline`.

**Blocks are aligned, not compared by position.** A small DP substitutes,
skips or merges blocks, so an operator who changed one wait on the tool costs
one mismatch instead of shifting everything after it. The first version of this
integrated the difference between the two timelines and could not tell a
card whose only difference was the first purge wait (60 s vs 300 s) from one
that differed everywhere.

**Content narrows it to a family; order and exclusivity pick the member.**
Consecutive growth cards are routinely identical (HADH75..HADH79 differ in no
step), so content alone cannot choose between them. `suggest_runcards` adds
three things, all validated against 200 already-tagged HA1P01 runs:

- a *save-time prior*: about a third of cards are saved seconds before their
  run starts, and a card saved long after its run was edited later;
- *exclusivity*: a growth card belongs to one run (the common recipes --
  CLEANING-1..5 and the other files at the runcard folder's top level -- to
  any number), solved as a min-cost bipartite matching;
- *order*: within a wafer series (HADH, HADG, ...) card numbers never went
  backwards in time across those 200 runs, so interchangeable cards are put
  back in run order, and a card outside the numbers of the tagged runs around
  it is penalised.

Pure: no Streamlit, no filesystem. The page reads files through
`io.runcard_index` and caches there.
