QC Report: one sample folder in, seven figures and a workbook out.

Pick a folder holding a 9-point Raman/PL/OM measurement grid, fit every
spectrum against one material's presets, segment every frame, and produce:

  1 Summary            overview page — OM grid, its class table, Raman and PL
                       fit-summary tables
  2 OM                 layer segmentation across the grid positions
  3 OM diagnostic      the same, plus the green-channel histograms showing
                       where each threshold landed
  4 Raman              the nine fitted Raman spectra
  5 Raman stats        fitted FWHM, peak centres and diagnostic ratios across
                       the positions, with the inherited spec lines drawn
  6 PL                 the nine fitted PL spectra
  7 PL stats           the same panels for PL

plus one .xlsx carrying every number behind them.

This is the merge of the Sample Report and QC Panel pages (v5.0.0). They read
the same folder, ran the same scan and fit, and each produced half of what an
operator wanted — so running both meant picking the same folder twice and
fitting the same spectra twice. The .pptx the Sample Report used to build is
gone with them, along with the PowerPoint COM rendering that rasterized it:
the seven PNGs and the workbook are the deliverable now, and nothing here
needs PowerPoint installed.

**One run.** One folder pick, one `run_sample_batch`, and every artifact
derived from that single result — so no two figures can describe different
fits of the same sample.

**Auto-detect.** A technique with no data is skipped rather than drawn empty,
and the inventory above the Run button says what was found before anything
runs. Two different absences get two different messages: a folder with no PL
files is a naming problem, a material with no PL block is a preset problem,
and they are fixed in different places.

**The threshold pair is derived per wafer.** A preset carrying an
`abs_threshold` pair gets that pair treated as a base the wafer's own pooled
frames can move, unless it opts out with `adaptive_threshold: false`. The
derivation runs once, before segmentation, because `analyse_frame` sees one
frame at a time. Which pair ran is printed on screen, written under the summary
page's OM table, and carried on every `OM_Stats` row — a page that does not
name its pair cannot be reproduced from itself.

The segmentation's other tunables — `nsigma`, `minpx`, the mask margin and the
flat-field divisor — come from the material preset's optical block for the
chosen layer, so a figure's numbers are reproducible from the sample folder
plus the committed preset. Tune them on the Material Presets page, not per
run; docs/OM_Contrast_Algo.md says when each is worth moving. A layer with no
block of its own runs the algorithm's own defaults, and the page says so.

    apiece — so name the selected material and let the operator check it.
