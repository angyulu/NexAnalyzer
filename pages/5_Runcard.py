"""
Runcard: a folder of recipe CSVs in, a comparable table and a profile chart out.

Point it at an archive folder and it reads every `.csv` beneath it, keeps the
ones that read as real recipes, and gives:

  1  a table  one row per recipe — total time, peak temperature, growth
               window, and the setpoint each gas, controller, valve and the
               stage was holding at the growth midpoint
  2  a chart  the ticked recipe replayed: the heater's reconstructed
               temperature with its cooldown tail, the preheaters, the growth
               window shaded, gas valves marked where they moved, and a gantt
               of every channel underneath

**The table is the point, and the chart is the follow-up.** Growers compare
recipes far more often than they read one, and the question is nearly always
"what was different about that run" — which is a row-to-row comparison, not a
chart. So every number the chart's summary block carries is also a column, and
the chart is what you open once a row looks wrong.

**A recipe folder holds more than recipes.** The tool writes its datalogs into
the same folders, and a datalog is a `.csv` that parses perfectly well: 6904
rows, the first named `Time`, the rest named after their own timestamps. They
are rejected by the one test that separates them — a real recipe's clock
advances and a datalog's does not — and the count of what was rejected is
shown, because a folder where *everything* was rejected is a folder that was
pointed at the wrong place.

**These are recipe clocks, not wall-clocks.** `Pumping` and `Pumping Forward`
hold for real time and state only a target pressure, so nothing in the file
says how long they took; every timestamp on this page is short by the
pump-down time before it. On the VBBE00 run that is about 14 minutes out of
133. Do not align these against a datalog by absolute seconds.

Long work, once: the folder walk parses every file in the tree and is done on
a folder pick and on an explicit reload, never on a widget interaction. Ticking
a different row redraws from state.
