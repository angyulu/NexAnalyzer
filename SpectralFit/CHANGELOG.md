# Changelog

All notable changes to SpectralFit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Multi-select file picker** for spectrum input: the sidebar now exposes a **"Browse Spectrum Files"** button that opens a native OS multi-select dialog (`tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilenames`), filtered to `.txt` with an "All files" fallback. Ctrl-click / Cmd-click to pick multiple files in one dialog session.
- Last-picked directory is remembered as the next dialog's starting location (session-state key `'last_picked_dir'`).
- Pop-based reload guard via a transient `'pending_files_to_load'` session-state queue — picked files are parsed exactly once on the next rerun; no per-rerun re-parsing.

### Changed
- **Sidebar "Load Spectra" block fully replaced**: the "Folder Path" text input and "Browse File Folder" button are removed. The new picker preserves all downstream behavior (multi-Y `__1`/`__2` splitting, `detect_mode_from_filename` auto-detection, per-file duplicate skipping, per-file error isolation).
- Subprocess output for the new picker is **JSON-serialized** (rather than bare `print()`) so picked paths with spaces, commas, or unicode round-trip safely.
- **PL "Raw" summary row** in the fit-results table is now rendered **at the top** of the table instead of the bottom — applies to both the in-app table ([src/visualization/unified_plot.py](src/visualization/unified_plot.py)) and the exported master CSV ([src/io/export.py](src/io/export.py)). Easier raw-vs-fit comparison.
- Sidebar success message reads `"Loaded N file(s)"` (dropped the "from folder" suffix).

### Removed
- Session-state keys `'last_folder_path'` and `'loaded_folder_path'` (replaced by `'last_picked_dir'` and `'pending_files_to_load'`). These keys were never written to project JSON, so existing saved projects load unchanged.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-02

### Changed
- **Removed Display Settings UI** from sidebar - plot width now defaults to Full (100%) everywhere
- **Moved Fit Results table** from right-side control panel to below the spectrum plot in center column
- **Removed "Residuals" subplot title** that overlapped with x-axis labels (y-axis label retained)

### Fixed
- All `plot_width_preset` defaults updated from "Standard" to "Full" across codebase

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Real-time preview for baseline correction** - See red dashed baseline preview before applying
- **Real-time preview for de-spiking** - See orange dashed preview of spike removal
- **X-range processing** - Crop spectrum to specific region before processing
- **Improved peak fitting algorithm** with critical fixes:
  - Fixed amplitude initialization (convert peak height to integrated intensity)
  - Shape-aware width initialization using Gaussian/Lorentzian mixing
  - Adaptive parameter bounds (wider tolerance for broader peaks)
  - Improved auto-find FWHM estimation with curvature-based fallback
  - Peak overlap detection with actionable warnings
- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
  - Simplified View Options with organized checkbox groups
  - Auto-managed plot layer visibility at each processing stage
  - Removed left file panel - plot now takes 70% width
  - File navigation dropdown with left/right buttons at top of plot
  - Scrollable control panel (800px height)
  - Reordered workflow sections for better flow
- **Algorithm documentation**:
  - Comprehensive Baseline_Algo.md (algorithm analysis)
  - Comprehensive Fitting_Algo.md (algorithm deep dive)
  - FITTING_IMPROVEMENTS.md (v2.2.1 enhancement summary)

### Changed
- **Plot visibility behavior** (auto-managed):
  - X-range stage: Show only "Raw" curve
  - Despike stage: Show "Raw" AND "De-spiked" for comparison
  - Baseline stage: Show "De-spiked" AND "Preview baseline" (red dashed)
  - Peak fit stage: Show "Corrected", "Fit Total", and optionally "Components"
- **Removed "Preview Corrected" green curve** from baseline preview (user request)
- **UI section order**: Processing Range → De-spiking → Baseline → Peak Fitting → Export → Reset to Raw → View Options
- **Amplitude bounds**: Increased from 2× to 5× max intensity (accounts for sharp peaks)

### Fixed
- **Critical crash fixes**:
  - Peak deletion IndexError when deleting non-consecutive rows (P0)
  - Peak addition TypeError when clicking "+" button (P0)
- **Behavioral fixes**:
  - Reset to Raw now restores original data (before X-range cropping)
  - Plot layers automatically clear when advancing to next processing stage
  - Preview states cleared after fitting runs (no stray preview curves)
- **Parameter fixes**:
  - Despike sensitivity range extended to 30.0 (was 15.0)
- **Fitting algorithm improvements**:
  - Fixed amplitude initialization (critical: lmfit expects integrated intensity, not peak height)
  - Fixed parameter extraction to handle both Parameter objects and floats
  - Fixed component curve evaluation (use kwargs not params dict)
  - Fixed FitResult validation (allow empty peaks when failed)
  - Fixed baseline parameter naming (lambda_ not lam)

### Quality Improvements
- **Expected R² improvement**: 0.85-0.92 → 0.95-0.99 (for well-behaved spectra)
- **Convergence rate improvement**: 60-70% → 90-95%
- **Bound-hitting issues**: Common → Rare
- **Auto-find quality**: Poor → Good

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- **Single-page, three-panel layout** (files/plot/controls)
- **X-range cropping** with data masking
- **Real-time preview** for despike and baseline operations
- **Full peak fitting** with Voigt models
- **Sequential workflow** with auto-expand accordion
- **Unified multi-layer plot** visualization

- **Peak Fitting section** with auto-find and manual peak management
- **View Options section** with layer visibility controls
- **Status tracking** with progress badges in file cards
