"""
Weighted, staged progress for a long report build.

Report generation is a chain of stages with wildly different costs, and the
user's real question during it is "is this working, or has it died?". A bar
that reaches 100% and disappears while three quarters of the work is still
to come answers that question wrongly, which is what this exists to fix.

The weights below are **measured**, not guessed, on a real 9-point sample
(``Example/HADG06``: 9 Raman + 9 PL 2000-point spectra, 9x 2240x1680 BMP
optical images) totalling 24.5 s:

    fit 5.28s (21.5%) | Raman figures 3.98s (16.2%) | PL figures 4.66s (19.0%)
    optical images 5.37s (21.9%) | .pptx 2.09s (8.5%) | preview 3.17s (12.9%)

Don't flatten them to equal shares. Equal weights would put the bar at 50%
when 78% of the time is still ahead, which is the same lie in a different
shape. If the pipeline changes materially, re-measure rather than estimate.

Aggregation (stats, legends, ratios) is deliberately absent: it takes 4 ms,
so a visible step for it would flicker past and buy nothing.

This module is intentionally free of Streamlit. It computes fractions and
labels; the caller decides what to draw. That keeps the arithmetic — the part
with the off-by-one and the divide-by-zero in it — testable without a
browser or a script runner.

    the fit stage is the only one that scales with it: rendering figures,
