"""
The QC Report's composed pages, drawn with matplotlib.

Two builders, both returning PNG bytes on a 13.333 x 7.5 inch page:

- `build_summary_figure()` — the overview: title bar; the 3x3 grid of raw OM
  frames with the per-class segmentation table beneath it on the left half;
  the Raman fit-summary table (optionally with trailing intensity-ratio rows)
  stacked above the PL one on the right half.
- `build_fit_grid_figure()` — one technique's nine points as three stacked
  columns (1/4/7, 2/5/8, 3/6/9), each column one image whose three panels share
  an X-axis, under one legend and one pair of axis titles serving the whole
  grid.

These replace `core/report/pptx.py`, deleted at v5.0.0 along with the
PowerPoint COM slide renderer that used to rasterize it. The page geometry is
carried over unchanged — the same inch rects, the same derived table heights,
the same aspect-preserving contain-fit for every embedded image — because it
was tuned against real samples and the proportions are the part worth keeping.
What is deliberately *not* carried over is PowerPoint's table styling: the blue
banded look came from a theme default that lives nowhere in this repo, and
these pages now sit beside five matplotlib figures in the same report. Matching
their siblings beats matching a deck nobody generates any more.

Technique-agnostic, like the module it replaces: it takes image bytes,
`PeakStat`s and `OpticalClassStat`s and imports neither technique package.
